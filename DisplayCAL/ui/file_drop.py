"""Reusable file drag-and-drop support for the Qt UI.

This is the Qt counterpart of the legacy :class:`DisplayCAL.wx_addons.FileDrop`
/ :class:`DisplayCAL.wx_windows.FileDrop`. Instead of subclassing a drop target
per widget, a :class:`FileDropTarget` is an event filter you install on any
widget, mapping file *suffixes* to handler callables.

Improvements over the wx version:

* Matching is by suffix (``str.endswith``), longest first, so multi-part
  extensions such as ``.vrml.gz`` are handled correctly (the wx version relied
  on :func:`os.path.splitext` and silently failed to match those).
* No global event/timer juggling; dispatch happens directly in the drop event.
