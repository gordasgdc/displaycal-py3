"""Tests for the Qt worker execution layer ``DisplayCAL.ui.worker_runner``.

``parse_progress`` (extracted from ``Worker.progress_handler``) is a pure
function tested without a display. The ``_ProducerThread`` / ``ProgressAdapter``
/ ``WorkerRunController`` driver is exercised headless via the shared offscreen
``QApplication``, with a fake worker so no Argyll / hardware is needed. See
``DisplayCAL/ui/MAINFRAME_PORT_PLAN.md`` (Stage 5, sub-slices 5b-i / 5b-ii).
